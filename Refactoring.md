# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

### Refactored code:

```JS
const crypto = require("crypto");

const TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY = "0";
const MAX_PARTITION_KEY_LENGTH = 256;

const hash = (data) => {
  return crypto.createHash("sha3-512").update(data).digest("hex");
};

const getCandidateFromEvent = (event) => {
  if (event.partitionKey) {
    return event.partitionKey;
  }
  return hash(JSON.stringify(event));
};

const stringifyCandidate = (candidate) => {
  return typeof candidate !== "string" ? JSON.stringify(candidate) : candidate;
};

const truncateCandidate = (candidate) => {
  return candidate.length > MAX_PARTITION_KEY_LENGTH ? hash(candidate) : candidate;
};

exports.deterministicPartitionKey = (event) => {
  if (!event) {
    return TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY;
  }

  let candidate = getCandidateFromEvent(event);
  candidate = stringifyCandidate(candidate);
  return truncateCandidate(candidate);
};
```

### Unit tests

```JS
const { deterministicPartitionKey } = require("./dpk-refactored");

describe("deterministicPartitionKey", () => {
  it("Returns the literal '0' when given no input", () => {
    const trivialKey = deterministicPartitionKey();
    expect(trivialKey).toBe("0");
  });

  it("should return event partition key if it exists", () => {
    const event = { partitionKey: "testKey" };
    expect(deterministicPartitionKey(event)).toBe("testKey");
  });

  it("should return hashed event data if partition key does not exist", () => {
    const event = { data: "testData" };
    /* expected hashed value */
    const expected =
      "a178b6bbc1a3b9f054bc0a5c4b2a6a5ed44ace1be361f4ad8174d7f9f77735d0069b93f34de0cb90fd8fefd8d973b29b6a7c4395a96f2397a8708531d6f49940";
    expect(deterministicPartitionKey(event)).toBe(expected);
  });

  it("should return hashed candidate if its length exceeds max allowed length", () => {
    const event = {
      partitionKey:
        "A long partitionKey must be greater that 256 characters to test the MAX_PARTITION_KEY_LENGTH condition in the `deterministicPartitionKey` function. This long partitionKey will be replaced with it's hash (event partitionKey's hash). This hashing function is generated by the crypto library.",
    };
    /* expected hashed value */
    const expected =
      "ddd15f8c34a50e572e478a3b74ea5d2f9921292601436cf3dadb922f20a412c442ce9ef6b255b8c4d4f5bb9e1a609b7d75fa1b8b40eea5856fffc57a463f80c1";
    expect(deterministicPartitionKey(event)).toBe(expected);
  });

  it("should return stringified candidate if not a string", () => {
    const event = { partitionKey: { key: "testKey" } };
    const expected = '{"key":"testKey"}';
    expect(deterministicPartitionKey(event)).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

The original function has been broken into smaller, more focused functions. each function has single responsibility. Constants have been move to global scope.
